    "When we code in Python, we'll typically use a combination of functions, variables, and numbers. A function is just like a mathematical function where it will take in an input and return an output. In this lab, we've already used the `print` function and the `max` function. Each function will have its own input guidelines (what type of values it takes in, and how many values). As we get more advanced, we can look at the **documentation**, or explanations and descriptions of the code, for different functions to make sure we're inputting the right things.\n",
